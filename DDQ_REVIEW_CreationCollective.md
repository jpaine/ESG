1. **Supply Chain Risk Management** - Incorrectly marked as "Non-existent" when evidence suggests Level 0
2. **Board Structure and Functioning** - Incorrectly marked as "Non-existent" when evidence suggests Level 0  
3. **Community Engagement and Impact** - Incorrectly marked as "Non-existent" when evidence suggests Level 0
4. **Comments lack specificity** - Many comments are generic and don't cite specific evidence from the memo

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Enhance Evidence-Based Assessment
The DDQ generator should:
- Extract specific evidence from the memo for each assessment
- Cite specific sections/quotes when available
- Distinguish between "no evidence found" vs "evidence suggests Level 0"

### 2. Improve Context Understanding
The system should better understand:
- **Supply Chain**: Extensive partner networks (200+ venues, 24+ promo, 18+ production) = supply chain engagement
- **Governance**: Investment rounds with external investors = board/oversight structures
- **Community Engagement**: Partnerships with venues, sponsors, tourism boards = stakeholder identification

### 3. Sector-Specific Considerations
For live entertainment/events companies:
- Venue partnerships = supply chain engagement
- Sponsor relationships = stakeholder engagement
- Multi-country operations = governance structures required
- Event operations = OHS compliance required

### 4. Comments Enhancement
Comments should:
- Reference specific evidence from the memo
- Explain why Level 0 vs Non-existent
- Note any sector-specific considerations
- Mention what evidence was found vs. not found

## Corrected Assessment Summary

### Areas Requiring Correction:
1. **Community Engagement and Impact**: Non-existent → **Level 0**
2. **Supply Chain Risk Management**: Non-existent → **Level 0**
3. **Board Structure and Functioning**: Non-existent → **Level 0**

### Areas to Verify:
1. **AML, KYC & KYB Management**: Verify if company handles payments directly (would be Level 0) or only through third-party (Non-existent may be correct)

## Next Steps

1. Update DDQ generator to better recognize:
   - Partner networks as supply chain engagement
   - Investment structures as governance evidence
   - Strategic partnerships as stakeholder engagement

2. Enhance prompt to instruct LLM to:
   - Look for indirect evidence (e.g., "partner network" = supply chain engagement)
   - Understand sector-specific indicators
   - Cite specific evidence in comments

3. Add sector-specific guidance for:
   - Live entertainment/events
   - Multi-country operations
   - Platform businesses
