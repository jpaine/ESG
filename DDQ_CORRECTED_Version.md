## CORRECTED ASSESSMENT:

### Risk Management Capacity

#### ESG Policy
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
Creation Collective operates across 16 countries in the live entertainment sector, which inherently involves environmental impact through event production, venue management, and transportation. The memo states: "16 operational stops and a vetted partner network (200+ venue options, 24+ promo/marketing, 18+ production)." Multi-country operations require basic compliance procedures across jurisdictions. While no explicit ESG policy is mentioned, the company's operational model and legal counsel hiring (memo mentions "Legal Counsel" in hiring plans) suggest minimal ESG procedures are in place to ensure regulatory compliance.

#### ESG Risk and Opportunity Identification
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
The memo indicates operations across 16 countries with diverse environmental and social impacts: "multi-country, end-to-end live entertainment platform" operating in "SG, HK, TW, TH, MY, ID, KR, AU, PH; selective CN/IN/JP." The company's engagement with "200+ venue options, 24+ promo/marketing, 18+ production partners" and management of multi-country tours requires basic identification of operational risks, including environmental (event production, waste), social (community impact, labor), and governance (regulatory compliance across jurisdictions) risks. While not formally documented, the operational complexity suggests basic risk identification activities exist.

#### ESG Reporting
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** Low

**Comments:**
No evidence of ESG reporting practices found in the provided information or web search results.

#### ESG Performance Management & Monitoring
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
The memo describes extensive partner network management: "200+ venue options, 24+ promo/marketing, 18+ production partners" across "16 operational stops." The company coordinates multi-country tours, manages venue contracts, production partners, and marketing relationships, which constitutes limited programs to manage operational and ESG-related risks. The memo states: "route planning across 16 stops; venue contracting; marketing/promo; production." This operational coordination across multiple countries and partners represents basic risk management activities, though not formally documented as ESG-specific programs.

### Environment

#### Environmental impact
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** Medium

**Comments:**
Operating in the live entertainment sector, Creation Collective's activities have environmental impacts related to event production, venue operations, and transportation. The memo states operations involve "venue contracting," "production," and multi-country routing. Multi-country operations require compliance with environmental permits or licenses as per national law in each jurisdiction. The company identifies risks where operations may impact the environment through event production activities.

#### Greenhouse gas emissions
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** Low

**Comments:**
No information or evidence suggests that Creation Collective has identified or tracks GHG emissions from its operations or value chain.

### Social

#### Labour Standards
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The memo indicates team structure with leadership roles (CEO, CCO, COO, Strategy/IR) and hiring plans for additional roles (Creative Director, Festival Director, Legal Counsel, Data/Tech Lead). Operations across 16 countries require compliance with local labor laws in each jurisdiction. The memo mentions "Employment: $3.19m (7%)" in use of funds, indicating formal employment structures. ESOP is mentioned (9.9% ownership), suggesting formal employment contracts. While no explicit HR policies are detailed, multi-country operations necessitate basic compliance with local labor laws.

#### Occupational Health & Safety Standards
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The live entertainment industry involves event production, technical equipment, venue operations, and multi-country show delivery. The memo states: "show delivery" and operations involving "production," "technical production," and venue management. Multi-country operations require compliance with relevant OH&S laws and regulations in each jurisdiction. Basic procedures to identify and mitigate hazards (particularly life-threatening ones) are likely in place for event operations, though not explicitly documented.

#### Child and Forced Labour Policy
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** Low

**Comments:**
No evidence of a child and forced labour policy was found in the provided documents or through web search.

#### Community Engagement and Impact
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The memo describes extensive stakeholder engagement: "Strategic partnerships" including "tourism/venue MOUs (e.g., Sentosa)," "brand sponsors (e.g., EDB, Amex)," and partnerships with "Boiler Room." The company identifies stakeholders through its "200+ venue options" and "24+ promo/marketing" partners. The memo states: "Corporate Sponsors & Brands: Companies seeking audience engagement and brand affinity via live event experiential marketing" and "Venues & Local Promoters: Partners collaborating with CC." This demonstrates stakeholder identification and engagement with venues, sponsors, tourism boards, and local communities affected by events.

#### Consumer Protection
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
Creation Collective operates a consumer-facing live entertainment platform with ticketing operations. The memo states: "Ticketing via Megatix (primary)" and mentions "pricing transparency" and consumer-facing events. The company operates across multiple countries, requiring compliance with relevant consumer protection laws in each jurisdiction. The memo mentions "fair and respectful treatment of clients" and "pricing transparency" as part of the business model, indicating basic consumer protection compliance.

#### Supply chain risk management
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The memo explicitly states: "200+ venue options, 24+ promo/marketing, 18+ production partners" and describes a "vetted partner network." The company engages extensively with supply chain partners for operational delivery: "Channel Partners: Ticketing (Megatix) for reach + analytics; local promoters/venues for on-ground execution." The memo mentions "partner mesh across 16 stops" and "partner retainers," indicating active engagement with partners to manage operational delivery and identify potential risks. M&A activity (Pitch Control acquisition) further demonstrates supply chain engagement.

### Governance

#### Commitment to Corporate Governance (CG)
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The memo details ownership structure: "Post-round: Founders: 67.5%, Seed investors: 22.6%, ESOP+others: 9.9%" and mentions "Current raise: $5m Seed at $15m pre-money." Investment structure with external seed investors suggests basic governance framework. The memo mentions "Legal Counsel" in hiring plans and "governance & rights: Board seat/observer" in use of funds, indicating attention to governance matters. Multi-country operations require basic governance structures for compliance and coordination.

#### Board Structure and Functioning
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** Medium

**Comments:**
The memo states ownership structure includes "Seed investors: 22.6%" and mentions "governance & rights: Board seat/observer" in the investment terms. The memo references "Quarterly pipeline QA" suggesting investor oversight and reporting mechanisms. The investment structure with external seed investors implies informal oversight and control processes are in place, though not explicitly detailed.

#### Compliance with Laws & Regulations
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
Creation Collective operates across 16 countries: "SG, HK, TW, TH, MY, ID, KR, AU, PH; selective CN/IN/JP." Multi-country operations necessitate compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in each jurisdiction, including event licensing, labor laws, tax regulations, and consumer protection. The memo mentions "Legal Counsel" in hiring plans, indicating attention to compliance matters. Basic compliance mechanisms are required for multi-jurisdictional operations.

#### Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Management
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
No information provided or found suggests the existence of ABC management processes or policy. However, given operations across 16 countries with varying corruption risk levels (including some with higher perceived corruption), and extensive partner/vendor relationships (200+ venues, 24+ promo, 18+ production partners), ABC management is highly material. The absence of explicit ABC processes represents a significant gap.

#### AML, KYC & KYB Management
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** Medium (changed from Low)

**Comments:**
The memo mentions future plans for "ticketing & data platform (dynamic pricing, membership)" and "owned ticketing for margin and data." Currently, the company uses "Megatix (primary)" for ticketing, which may handle payments through a third party. If the company plans to handle payments directly through its own platform, AML/KYC/KYB would become highly material. No evidence of such processes was found. Materiality is Medium given future platform plans, though currently Low if payments are entirely third-party.

#### GRM & PPM
**Level:** Non-existent  
**Materiality:** **High** (changed from Medium)

**Comments:**
No evidence suggests the operation of a grievance redress mechanism accessible in relevant languages or linking to AIIB's PPM. However, given the company's community-facing operations (events affecting local communities, venues, fans, sponsors) and multi-country presence, a grievance mechanism is highly material. The absence represents a gap for a company with significant community impact.

#### Cyber Security and Data Governance
**Level:** Level 0  
**Materiality:** High

**Comments:**
The memo describes a "digital platform for live entertainment" with current ticketing operations and future plans for "ticketing & data platform (dynamic pricing, membership)" and "data initiatives." The company operates a digital platform requiring basic cyber security measures. The memo mentions "AI-assisted" features and data initiatives, indicating digital operations that require basic security and data governance. While specific practices are not documented, digital platform operations imply basic cyber threat and data security risk governance elements.
